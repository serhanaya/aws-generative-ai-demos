# AWS-GAI-Summarize: Text Summarization for Manufacturing Issue Resolution

## Project Overview

This project streamlines issue resolution processes for manufacturers of large equipment.  It harnesses Generative AI to summarize lengthy incident reports and related data, allowing equipment experts (SMEs) to make faster, more informed decisions.

**Problem:** Incident reports in the manufacturing industry can be extensive, making it time-consuming for SMEs to diagnose and resolve equipment issues.

**Solution:**  A text summarization solution powered by foundation models reduces the time SMEs spend reviewing reports, improving response times and overall productivity.

## Use Case: Large Turbine Manufacturer

1. A technician at a remote turbine site creates a detailed incident report with images.
2. The report is submitted to a custom application.
3. An equipment SME reviews the report to determine the root cause and provide a solution. 
4. The Generative AI summarization solution condenses the incident report, aiding the SME's diagnosis.
